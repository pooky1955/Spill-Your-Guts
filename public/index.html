    <meta name="description" content="Spill Your Guts analyses your microbiome using a form in which users input information about their daily food intake to receive personalized information on their gut. Proportions are calculated and specific results will be provided. In these results, there will be information about each macronutrient’s effect on the gut as well as a list of the bacteria that are affected by the user’s diet, along with information about those bacteria.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
